# Elgg brainstorm

This plugin offer ability to feedback/brainstorm members of groups. I am inspired from [http://uservoice.com/feedback]()

## Rules
Members can easily submit and discuss ideas, and vote from 1 to 3 about them.  
Each member start with 10 points. When it reach zero, he cannot vote. This system prevents fraud and vocal minorities.

Members get back points when an idea is accepted (or declined) by group owner.  
This make sure people focus on the ideas they care most about.

When user submit idea, live search makes sure that members find similar feedback to vote for rather than create a new (duplicate) entry.

###It's a very good system to create a dynamic and fun system for brainstorm and feedback on your group.

## Features

- Live search on idea and highlight result.
